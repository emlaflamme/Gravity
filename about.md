I'm interested in creating cities that promote health. This is a simple sentence, that actually is anything but. 

I work as a Senior Epidemiologist at the Chicago Department of Public Health, dedicated to developing and implementating a data strategy that allows us to predict and measure the health impacts of place-based and community development initiatives.
